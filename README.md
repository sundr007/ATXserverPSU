ATX computer power supply utilizing redundant server power supplies for mining applications.
The Server power supplies will converter AC to 12Vdc with high efficiency.
The ATXs box will then take that 12V, create 5V and 3.3V, supply the needed logic and then provide a modular ATX connector set to connect to the mother board, graphics cards, etc.

The biggest benefit of this system is that the server power supplies will provide very high output power at high efficiency.

The circuit boards are done in KiCAD.
The mechanicals are done in OpenSCAD.
